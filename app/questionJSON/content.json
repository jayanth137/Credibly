    "summary": "This video explains OAuth 2.0, a protocol that allows websites to access user data on other websites without requiring passwords. It compares OAuth 1.0 and 2.0, highlighting improvements in security and ease of implementation. The video delves into access tokens, their function, and how they're used in the authorization code flow. It further explains the roles of resource servers and identity providers, distinguishing between authentication and authorization. Finally, the video discusses the four OAuth 2.0 flows (authorization code, client credentials, resource owner password, and implicit), the benefits of using JWTs with OAuth 2.0, and the future of OAuth.",
